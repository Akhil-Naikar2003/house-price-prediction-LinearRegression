# house-price-prediction-LinearRegression



This is a web application built with Flask that uses a machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict house prices based on various features like average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and area population.

## Features
- **House Price Prediction**: The app allows users to input certain parameters and predicts the price of a house.
- **Model & Scaler**: The model (`lm_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) are pre-trained and saved for prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app is designed with an intuitive HTML form where users can input the required data for prediction.
